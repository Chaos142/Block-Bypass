# Block-Bypass
A list of functioning offline downloads for all of the stuff on my website after it got blocked.

A mirror of the website is available [here](https://eldritchdev2.github.io/Website-v2/)

## Lightspeed agent
You can use the uploaded `.bat` files to kill off Lightspeed agent and unblock any website as well as `wss://` (websocket) conncections to blocked domains, however this only works on Windows computers.

## Eaglercraft:
The latest 1.5.2 and 1.8.8 offline clients are available for download. 
## Five nights at Winston's
The offline download is available.

## Other games:
Doom, Retal, Quake, Slope, Bananabread and all of the other games that must run in a web environment cannot be run locally. Might migrate my site soon.
